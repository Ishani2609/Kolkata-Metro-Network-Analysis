**Optimizing Kolkata's Urban Transit: A Data-Driven Study of the Metro System**

**Project Summary: Kolkata Metro Network Analysis**

This project analyzes the Kolkata Metro Network using data analysis and visualization techniques. It primarily focuses on understanding the structure and efficiency of the metro system through Python, Pandas, and Plotly. Below is a brief overview of the key components of the analysis:

**Data Loading & Preprocessing:**

The dataset (Kolkata Metro Network.csv) contains information about metro stations, metro lines, and distances.
Pandas is used to read and clean the dataset.

**Metro Line Analysis:**

The project calculates the number of stations per line.
It determines the total and average distance covered by each metro line.
Visualization & Data Insights:

Uses Plotly for interactive visualizations.
Folium is used to create an interactive map of the metro network.
Bar charts and line plots are generated to show metro line statistics.

**Key Findings:**

Distribution of stations across different metro lines.
Average distance between metro stations on each line.
This project effectively provides data-driven insights into the Kolkata Metro system, helping in understanding its structure, reach, and efficiency.
Key Insights from the Analysis
After performing the calculations and visualizations, here are the key insights:

Metro Station Distribution

Some metro lines have more stations than others.
This could indicate higher passenger demand in certain areas.
Average Distance Between Stations

Some metro lines have closely spaced stations, while others have longer gaps between stations.
This could indicate differences in how the metro lines are planned (urban vs suburban).
Metro Network Coverage

The interactive map shows the geographic distribution of stations.
Helps in understanding which areas are well-covered and which need more metro connectivity.
**Conclusion**
This project provides a data-driven overview of the Kolkata Metro Network. It helps in understanding:

How metro stations are distributed across different lines.
How far stations are from each other.
How the metro network is structured geographically.

This analysis can be useful for: ✔ Urban planners → To optimize metro expansion.
✔ Commuters → To understand metro connectivity better.
✔ Researchers → To analyze urban transport systems.
